Description:
The Currency Converter is a web application that allows users to convert between different currencies based on real-time exchange rates. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface. Users can input an amount in one currency, select the source and target currencies, and the app will display the converted amount using up-to-date exchange rates.

Features:

Dropdown menus to select source and target currencies.
Real-time exchange rate fetching (can use an API like Exchangerate-API or Open Exchange Rates).
Display of the converted amount.
Clean and simple UI with responsive design.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for creating the structure of the currency converter form, dropdowns, and buttons.
CSS: Used for styling the form and making the layout responsive across devices.
JavaScript: Handles user input, currency conversion logic, and fetching real-time exchange rates via an API.
Objective:
To build a simple yet practical web application for converting currencies. This project is great for practicing integration with APIs, handling user input, and performing calculations with JavaScript.
